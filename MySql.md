##### **Getting Started**

You can write two types of comments in MySQL:

> 💬 **Single-Line Comments:**
> These start with “–”. Any text that goes after the dash and till the end
> of the line will not be taken into account by the compiler.
> Example:
>
> ```
> -Update all:
> SELECT * FROM Movies;
> ```

> 💬 **Multi-Line Comments:**
> These start with /_ and end with _/. Again, any text that is beyond the
> slashes lines will be ignored by the compiler.
> Example:
>
> ```
> /*Select all the columns
> of all the records
> in the Movies table:*/
> SELECT * FROM Movies;
> ```
