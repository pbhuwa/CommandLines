## Setup Git

Before you can start using Git and GitHub, you need to install Git and configure it on your machine.

### Install Git

- **macOS:** `brew install git`
- **Windows:** Download from [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- **Linux:** `sudo apt install git`

### Configure Git

Once Git is installed, configure your name and email address. This information will be used in your commits.

```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
```

To verify your setup:

```
git config --global --list
```

---

## Create a Repository

### Initialize a New Repository

To create a new Git repository:

1. Navigate to your project directory:

   ```
   cd path/to/your/project
   ```

2. Initialize the Git repository:

   ```
   git init
   ```

3. Add a remote (optional, for GitHub repository):

   ```
   git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git
   ```

---

## Basic Git Commands

### Clone a Repository

Clone a remote repository from GitHub to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
```

This creates a local copy of the remote repository.

---

### Check the Status of Your Repository

To view the current status of your repository, including untracked, modified, and staged files:

```
git status
```

---

### Add Changes to Staging

Add changes to the staging area before committing them:

- Add specific file:

  ```
  git add filename
  ```

- Add all files:

  ```
  git add .
  ```

---

### Commit Changes

To commit your staged changes:

```
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

A commit message should clearly describe what has been changed.

---

### Push Changes

Push your local commits to the remote repository:

```
git push origin branch-name
```

For example, to push to the `main` branch:

```
git push origin main
```

---

### Pull Changes

Fetch and merge changes from the remote repository:

```
git pull origin branch-name
```

Example to pull changes from `main`:

```
git pull origin main
```

---

### View Commit History

To view the commit history:

```
git log
```

To view a simplified version with one-line summaries:

```
git log --oneline
```

---

### Branching and Merging

#### Create a New Branch

To create a new branch:

```
git branch branch-name
```

#### Switch to a Branch

To switch to an existing branch:

```
git checkout branch-name
```

#### Merge Branches

To merge a branch into your current branch:

```
git merge branch-name
```

---

### Tagging

Tags are used to mark specific points in history, typically for releases.

#### Create a Tag

```
git tag -a v1.0 -m "Release version 1.0"
```

#### Push a Tag to GitHub

```
git push origin v1.0
```

---

## Working with GitHub

### Create a Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com).
2. Click on the **New** repository button.
3. Provide a repository name, description, and visibility (public/private).
4. Click **Create repository**.

### Push a Local Repository to GitHub

1. Initialize a Git repository locally:

   ```
   git init
   ```

2. Add and commit your changes:

   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

3. Add the GitHub repository as a remote:

   ```
   git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git
   ```

4. Push your changes:

   ```
   git push -u origin main
   ```

---

### Fork a Repository

To fork a repository from GitHub:

1. Navigate to the repository you want to fork.
2. Click the **Fork** button in the upper-right corner.
3. You will now have a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

---

### Create a Pull Request

To create a pull request:

1. Push your changes to your forked repository on a new branch.
2. Go to the original repository on GitHub.
3. Click **New Pull Request**.
4. Select your branch and compare it with the base branch (e.g., `main`).
5. Add a title and description, then click **Create Pull Request**.

---

## Git Configuration

### Set Global Configuration

Configure user name and email globally:

```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"

```

### View Current Configuration

To view your current configuration settings:

```
git config --list
```
