## Notes
- Replace `<package-name>` with the actual name of the package you wish to install or manage.
- Make sure you have Node.js and NPM installed on your system before executing these commands.
- For global installations (e.g., Vue CLI), you may need administrator privileges, so use `sudo` on Linux/macOS or run the command prompt as an administrator on Windows.

## Conclusion

These `npm` commands are essential for managing and developing Vue.js projects. With these tools, you can efficiently manage dependencies, run your development server, build for production, and test your code. Be sure to refer to the [Vue CLI documentation](https://cli.vuejs.org/) for more details and advanced usage.

Happy coding!
